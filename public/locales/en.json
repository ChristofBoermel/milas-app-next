    "card21": "Already 21, you really are a grandmother. I can't believe we've only known each other for 4 and a half months, but it already feels like an eternity. We've already experienced so much and I hope for many more beautiful, annoying, cringe, sad, angry and loving moments with you. You really give me so much and enrich me like no one before. I just want you to know that you are really unique and something special. I thank you for coming into my life. I really wish that you stay so clumsy so I can continue to laugh at you. I can't have a perfect girlfriend without make. I love you Frettchen.",
    "card22": "Heyy Mausii, how did you turn 22 so fast, you officially achieved umc status. We legit made so many memories together, it's hard to count every single one of them. We overcame so many hardships, lived mundane, were adventurous, had our first vacation together, elevated out relationship onto a whole another level. I'm so incredibly grateful to be considered your boyfriend. You have such a fierce personality, you're unique in so many ways and you radiate so many vibes and good energies that some people don't know how to handle that. You have brought art in my life that and that is something that no one before you ever did. I am so eager to know what the next year will bring upon you. Until then I love you to the end of the universe and back <3 In love your Mäuserich"
