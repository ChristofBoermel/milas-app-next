We've already experienced so much and I hope for many more beautiful, annoying, cringe, sad, angry and loving moments with you. You really give me so much and enrich me like no one before. I just want you to know that you are really unique and something special. I thank you for coming into my life. I really wish that you stay so clumsy so I can continue to laugh at you. I can't have a perfect girlfriend without make. I love you Frettchen.",
    "card22": "Hey Frettchen! Another year has passed - you're now 22! This year was full of wonderful moments, shared adventures and unforgettable memories. You took me on a journey this year that I will never forget. Every day with you is a gift and I am so grateful that you are a part of my life. Here's the new card for your 22nd birthday! ðŸŽ‰"
